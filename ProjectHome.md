The Accessibility Inspector for Firebug gives developers the ability to examine the accessibility features found in the Document Object Model (DOM) of web sites and web applications.  Firebug Accessibility Inspector generates a report on accessibility problems and features of HTML and ARIA enabled web resources.  When in the HTML tab of Firebug the accessibility report information on the DOM node can be viewed in the new DOM+ and A11y tabs.<br>
